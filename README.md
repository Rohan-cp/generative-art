# generative-art

Usually as a programmer, you have a bunch of spcifications and you write code to fit them. Here, however, you take directive on what to do or make. The only rules for what's on the canvas are determined by you. For me, it's a nice break to think of coding in this different paradigm (and trust me when I say it is different). For example, you can use the coordinates of a circle (x, y) on a canvas to determine its color by RGB like (x, y, 0) for this case. You would almost never think about things like this with normal programming. I though this idea was really interesting and it can definitely create a pretty cool pattern.

I also want say that all of my skectches here were made on OpenProcessing and are inspired from youtube videos and online forums. If you're interested in generative art I highly recommend you check out Algorithmic Art.

This is one of the first sketches I ever made and it actually uses this idea and the size of the circle is also dependent on its x-coordinate that creates this interesting light funnel.

Another aspect of this I enjoy is leveraging math to create unique and pretty designs.
